			<h1>Dwelv</h1>
			<p>Dwelv is an esolang created by CreeperBomb in 2023 with a string-rewriting paradigm with a single editable string.
				 It is Turing complete as it can simulate a Minsky machine. It was made whlie trying to describe how something changed in a scrapped language.</p>
			<h2>Specification</h2>
			<p>The first line contains how the string will start as. Each line after that will be run begins with a "state name", then a colon and space, 
				and then the state's code ("sequence (of instructions)"/"code sequence"/etc.). If a line is not structured like this or the code is invalid, 
				the line will be ignored and treated like a comment.The first line is run first, and states will loop unless interrupted. State names may not 
				contain quotes, apostrophes, whitespace other than regular space, trailing or beggining space, parenthesis, square brackets, curly brackets, 
				pipes, backticks, commas, semicolons, or colons.<br>
				
				Each neighboring instruction in a state is seperated by either a comma or semicolon (plus a space). If seperated by a comma and the first is 
				run and "fails" (has no impact), then the second instruction is run but is otherwise skipped. For example, in <code>A, B, C</code> C would only 
				be run if both A & B fail. If seperated by a semicolon, then both will always run in sequence. In <code>A, B; C</code>, C would always run but 
				B may not. You can also use parenthesis to group instructions together, so in <code>A, (B; C)</code> C would only run when B ran, unlike the 
				previous example.<br>
				
				There are two instruction types: replacement and changing the state. Replacement is structured as <code>"[Initial string]" -> "[Final string]"</code>. 
				The quotes can also be apostrophes with no effect. Any instance of the initial string will replaced with the final string, with leftward 
				preference (so <code>"11" -> "00"</code> on <code>111</code> results in <code>001</code>). It has some special characters that come with it, 
				which can be escaped using <code>`</code>. They are:
